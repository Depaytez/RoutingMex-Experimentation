# RoutingMex-Experimentation
An experimentation of a software program to find the shortest path from a starting point through several possible nodes and edges to an end point. 
Its applicable in infrastructure routing such as pipeline routing, road routing, farm logistic routing, and more. 
I aim to implement API for developers to integrate this solution in to their projects, while this is not the real project, but a place to play with things before implementing in the real project in a dedicated repository
