# RoutingMex-Experimentation
An experimentation of a software program to find the shortest path from a starting point through several possible nodes and edges to an end point. 
Its applicable in infrastructure routing such as pipeline routing, road routing, farm logistic routing, and more. 
I aim to implement API for developers to integrate this solution in to their projects, while this is not the real project, but a place to play with things before implementing in the real project in a dedicated repository 

## Project Tasks and Plan
### Task 1: Define the Problem and Requirements
- Identify the problem and requirements of the project
- Define the scope of the project
- Identify the target audience and stakeholders
- Define the project timeline and milestones
### Task 2: Choose a Programming Language and Framework
- Choose a suitable programming language and framework for the project
- Consider factors such as performance, scalability, and ease of use
### Task 3: Design the Database Schema
- Design a database schema to store the graph data
- Consider factors such as data normalization, indexing, and query optimization
### Task 4: Implement the Graph Data Structure
- Implement a graph data structure to represent the nodes and edges
- Consider factors such as adjacency list, adjacency matrix, and edge list
### Task 5: Implement the Shortest Path Algorithm
- Implement a shortest path algorithm such as Dijkstra's algorithm or A\* algorithm
- Consider factors such as time complexity, space complexity, and edge cases
### Task 6: Implement the API
- Implement a RESTful API to interact with the graph data structure
- Consider factors such as API endpoints, request and response formats, and error handling
### Task 7: Test and Debug the Code
- Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the code works correctly
- Debug the code to fix any issues or bugs
### Task 8: Deploy the API
- Deploy the API to a production environment
### Task 9: Monitor and Maintain the API
- Monitor the API for performance and security issues
- Maintain the API by updating the code, fixing bugs, and adding new features
### Task 10: Document the API
- Document the API using API documentation tools such as Swagger or API Blueprint
- Provide examples of how to use the API
### Task 11: Integrate with Other Systems
- Integrate the API with other systems such as web applications, mobile apps, or other APIs
### Task 12: Evaluate and Refine the API
- Evaluate the API's performance, scalability, and usability
- Refine the API based on user feedback and testing results
### Task 13: Plan for Future Development
- Plan for future development and maintenance of the API
### Task 14: Review and Refine the Code
- Review the code for best practices and coding standards
- Refine the code to improve performance, readability, and maintainability
### Task 15: Finalize the Project
- Finalize the project by completing all tasks and delivering the API to the stakeholders
### Task 16: Document the Project
- Document the project's requirements, design, implementation, and testing
- Provide a project report and lessons learned
